# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

### My work on the course project for Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

Although I usually do not stuff my files like this, I decided to keep all the functionality in the run_analysis.R skript.    I hope this makes it easier to you, the reader, to review it if all information is kept in one place.

The first part of the skript reads the data into two seperate data frames, using the contents of the features.txt file to calculate the dimensions.
